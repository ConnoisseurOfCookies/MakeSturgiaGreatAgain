<h1>Sturgia Rebalance</h1>

The intent of this mod is to fix some of the issues plagueing the Sturgian faction in Bannerlord.

In its current state Sturgia is barely a jack of all traits and despite being meant to be an infantry focused faction it has some of the worst top tier infantry in the game.

Enter this mod, the intent is to rebalance the Sturgian faction so that they get funnelled into a specific playstyle that incentivizes dismounted combat in close terrain such as sieges, bridge battles, villages and hilly terrain. That includes:

<h2>Archetype Reshift</h2>

Vanilla Sturgia draws most of its influence from its Slavic inspiration. Although I have no problem with that I am far more familiar with Norse unit archetypes. Thus I have opted to lean heavily into these influences.

I have replaced the Sturgian noble line cavalry with elite infantry, I have buffed the pre-existing infantry units and relegated the Sturgian regular cavalry to light skirmishers.

Despite this apparent nerving of those non-faction specialist troops I have also buffed their dismounted melee prowess. Now the cavalry is basically mounted infantry and the archers are two-handed infantry with bows!!

<h2>Shields!</h2>

Because even the recruits in my current version have shields the Sturgian army will be heavily resistant to projectiles. The idea is that the Sturgians can set up a solid counter to projectiles and even the most basic of infantry units have a high chance of survival.

<h2>Tactics</h2>

As touched on earlier I want the Sturgians to be defensively solid in the open and aggressive and dangerous in close quarters. A Sturgian player should look to choose the battle terrains well so he can take full advantage of their strengths.

The purpose of the cavalry is to defend the flanks of the Sturgian shield wall, particularly from Khuzaiti horse archers and the like, allowing the archers and infantry with throwing weapons to deal some actual damage. And if the enemy is being defensive they can tease them off their position by engaging them with their javelins.

The archers are mostly there to provide some degree of range capability. They are ok as archers but really shine when the enemy (mistakenly) thinks they can bully them in melee.

<h2>Additional Points</h2>

I know a lot of the Sturgian troops I have rekitted have supposedly non-culturally relevant weaponry. 

For example a lot of the top-tier infantry has imperial maces. That is because blunt single handed weapons are simply the best one-handed weapons in the game, reason being they ignore a quite significant amount of armour. That is the reason the Imperial Legionary is simply the best infantry in the vanilla game. Since I want the Sturgians to field the best infantry in the game I simply cannot ignore that.

Another is that I have pretty much replaced all spears with single use throwing spears. My reasoning for that is simple. Culturally the Norsemen used spears and axes primarily. There are multiple accounts from the sagas of them throwing spears in both battle and duels. Although axes were thrown in battle as well I feel like that was done more often for exhibition rather than battle. In either case a faction taking inspiration from the Norsemen should have throwing spears.

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I'll add a script to edit the cultural bonus to further incentivize a more 'Viking' like playstyle. Who knows.</li>

<li>I feel like top heavy weapons like axes should deal a mixture of cutting and blunt damage instead of just cutting damage. That way I could cut back on their raw skill bonuses.</li>

<li>Should probably edit the lords' equipment. It doesn't feel right watching a lord on a horse sitting above a sea of infantry</li>

<li>Maybe add more names to increase the cultural flavor of the faction</li>
</ul>
